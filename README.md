I wrote this program just before Hurricane Lane was sit to hit here.  I was worried about losing power so I created this sort of mock draft app in case I had to draft my Fantasy Football team over the phone.  I can keep track of what players I had drafted and which players were still available.  One day, maybe next summer, I will update it to actually work as a full fledged mock draft app 

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
